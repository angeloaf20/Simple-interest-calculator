# Simple-interest-calculator
This is my first project that I'm publishing.
I have no idea what I'm doing or how to use git since I just care about making simple projects (for now).
This is one of those projects and I'm a little proud of this one.
All it does is calculate the interest charge on a loan. It has a GUI to make it a little more user-friendly.
